# ABCD Workshop Simulated Data

The files contained include 10000 cases simulated from the covariance matrix of the ABCD release. As such, all data is anonymized and freely available for use. Behavioral data is simulated from an executive function variable and a set of 104 graph metrics derived from MRI data. 

Brain data is generated from the group-average covariance matrix of the 352 ROIs from the Gordon parcellation. Raw timeseries (TR=300) is provided for each ROI.
