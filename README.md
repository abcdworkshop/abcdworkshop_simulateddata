# ABCD Workshop Simulated Data

The files contained include 10000 cases simulated from the covariance
matrix of the ABCD release (2.0.1). As such, all data is anonymized and
freely available for use. Behavioral data is simulated from an executive
function variable and a set of 104 graph metrics derived from MRI data.

Brain data is generated from the group-average covariance matrix of the
352 ROIs from the Gordon parcellation. Raw timeseries (TR=150-500) is
provided for each ROI.

These data were simulated in order to provide users with a similar
experience to working with ABCD data, without needing access to the
sensitive data. All data are generated to be normally distributed based
on the covariance matrix of continuous measures within the dataset. All
simulated data are provided free for use.

Next Steps: 1. Synthesize a subset of variables from the ABCD, including
ordinal and categorial variables. 2. Providing longitudinal behavioral
and longitudinal data.
